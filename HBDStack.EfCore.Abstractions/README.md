# HBDStack.EfCore.Abstractions

This project is a part of the HBDStack suite of tools designed to simplify and streamline working with Microsoft's Entity Framework Core.

## Overview

These definitions may include standard repositories, unit of work schemas, and possibly diverse entity definitions.

## Features

- **Abstraction of standard repositories**: Facilitates consistent application of repository pattern across HBDStack applications.
- **Unit of Work schemas**: Offers an encapsulation of the scope of operations with a database.
