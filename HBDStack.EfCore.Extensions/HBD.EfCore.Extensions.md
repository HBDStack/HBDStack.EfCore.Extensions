## Overview

Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, extensible, cross-platform variation of the widely-used Entity Framework data access technology. However, to operationalize the Entity Framework, several things need to be defined and configured:

### Automated EntityTypeConfiguration
When working with EfCore, for every new Entity you add, you need to define the configuration of IEntityTypeConfiguration and incorporate them into the `OnConfiguring` of the DbContext. This library provides a more automated, efficient way to accomplish this.

1. Establish a generic type of `IEntityTypeConfiguration`. For instance, it could be called `DefaultEntityTypeConfiguration`.
```csharp
internal class DefaultEntityTypeConfiguration<T> : IEntityTypeConfiguration<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    public override void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<T> builder)
    {
        // Configuration details that will apply to all Entities inherited from BaseEntity
    }
}
```
2. Your Base Entity
```csharp
//Base entity should inherit IEntity from HBDStack.EfCore.Abstractions where the magic happens.
public abstract class BaseEntity : IEntity
{
    /// The ID property will be shared across all child classes
    [Key]
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public int Id {get; set;}

    /// Base classes need a constructor to allow child classes to define a private constructor
    protected BaseEntity()
    {
    }
}
```
3. Define the Entities

```csharp
public class User: BaseEntity
{
    public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";

    [Required]
    [MaxLength(256)]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [MaxLength(256)]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

4. Service Configuration
```csharp
//Use this configuration if your Entities are in the same assembly as `YourDbContext`
service.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(builder=>{
    builder.UseSqlServer(ConnectionString)
            //This is crucial
            .UseAutoConfigModel()
});

//Or use this configuration if your Entities are in a different assembly than `YourDbContext`
service.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(builder=>{
    builder.UseSqlServer(ConnectionString)
            //This is crucial
            .UseAutoConfigModel(op => op.ScanFrom([YourAssempbly])
});
```

That's all. The User entity will automatically load using `DefaultEntityTypeConfiguration` at runtime. However, if a specific configuration needs to be defined for a particular entity, you can still define a dedicated configuration class for that entity. The library is intelligent enough to detect your configuration at runtime without any additional requirements.

5. Define a dedicated configuration class for a specific entity.
```csharp
internal class UserTypeConfiguration<T> : IEntityTypeConfiguration<User>
{
    public override void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<User> builder)
    {
        // Define your configuration here.
    }
}
```

6. Excluding an Entity from Automatic Type Configuration
   There might be instances where you need to exclude a specific entity from the automatic type configuration described above. In such cases, you can utilize the `[IgnoreEntityMapper]` attribute to achieve this. The following code snippet illustrates how to implement this:

```csharp
[IgnoreEntityMapper]
public class OtherEntity: BaseEntity
{
    
}
```
This attribute allows you to retain control over your entity configurations, providing flexibility when certain entities require a different configuration approach.

### Data Seeding Management
In EFCore, managing data seeding necessitates the definition of static data along with the entity configuration within the same `EntityTypeConfiguration` class. To make this process more manageable, this library offers an alternative way to handle data seeding. The library takes care of the complexities, allowing you to focus on defining your seeding strategy.

A distinct advantage of this approach is that it enables the consolidation of all data seeding configurations into separate classes and folders, significantly improving organization and maintainability.

Define a specific data seeding class
```csharp
public class DefaultUserData : IDataSeedingConfiguration<User>
{
    public ICollection<User> Data => new[]
    {
        new User
        {
            Id = 1,
            FirstName = "Admin",
            LastName = "Account"
        }
    };
}
```
This approach allows for a more streamlined and organized way to manage data seeding, enhancing overall productivity and efficiency.

### Enum-Based Static Data Seeding

As developers, we understand that when enum data gets stored in a database it is represented as an integer. This can pose a challenge for support teams in correctly identifying the meaning of these values.
Consequently, we've introduced a new library that offsets this issue and offers a simple way to store enum classes as table data via the `[StaticData("TableName")]` attribute.
Below is an example of how you can use this feature:

```csharp
[StaticData(nameof(EnumStatus))]
public enum EnumStatus
{
    UnKnow,
    Active,
    InActive
}
```
With this implementation, each enum status is more easily identifiable for better clarity and maintenance.

### Dynamic Query Ordering
In the development of REST-APIs, a common requirement is the ability to order or filter data loaded from a database based on a field name provided by the UI or consumer. This necessitates building up the queryable at the EfCore level. The challenge lies in converting the field name, which is a string value, into an EfCore queryable.

This library simplifies this process by providing extension methods to facilitate dynamic query ordering. The example below demonstrates how to use these methods:

```csharp
 var result = await Db.Set<User>()
            .AsQueryable()
            .OrderByDynamics(
                //Orders the 'FirstName' field in ascending order.
                new DynamicOrderInfo("FirstName",OrderingDirection.Asc), 
                //Orders the 'UserName' field in the 'Account' navigation property in descending order.
                new DynamicOrderInfo("Account.UserName",OrderingDirection.Desc))
            .ToListAsync();
```
With these extension methods, you can easily convert string values into EfCore queryable and perform dynamic query ordering with minimal effort.

### Global Query Filters

Global query filters are a very useful feature provided by EfCore that applies such filters automatically to any LINQ queries involving those Entity Types. EF Core also applies them to Entity Types, referenced indirectly through use of Include or navigation property. Some common applications of this feature are:
- Soft delete - An Entity Type defines an IsDeleted property.
- Multi-tenancy - An Entity Type defines a TenantId property.

In order to utilize this feature, the suitable filters should be registered concurrently in the `IEntityTypeConfiguration` class. Similar to the Data Seeding Management process, this library includes an `IGlobalModelBuilderRegister` interface. It separates the management of global query filters from the Entity Type Configuration process.
An example of global query filter usage is outlined below:

```csharp
public class SampleQueryRegister : IGlobalModelBuilderRegister
{
     public void Apply(ModelBuilder? modelBuilder, DbContext context)
     {
         //Define your filter here
          modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
            .HasQueryFilter(x => !x.IsDelete);
     }
}
```
